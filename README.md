# Motivational Quotation Generator

## Description
I wrote a JavaScript program that generates a random quotation each time the code is run. The program can randomly display 10 different quotations.
I built this project to test out Git and GitHub functions. I also wanted to create code that motivated other coders in their coding journey. From this project, I learned how easy and useful it is to upload a project to GitHub using Git and Visual Studio Code.

## Features
+ Math.floor(Math.random() * 11) to generate a random number between 1 and 10.
+ A switch statement to output a motivational quotation depending on the number generated by Math.floor(Math.random() * 11)
+ Giving randomNumber the value of an empty string so that this variable can then be reassigned in the switch statement
## How to Use
Simply refresh the code to receive a randomly generated motivational quotation!
## Technologies
Visual Studio Code - the command line used to create the code
JavaScript - the program
Git - manages the source code
GitHub - hosts and stores the Git repository
